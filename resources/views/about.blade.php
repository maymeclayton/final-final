  <h1 class="mt-5">About Us</h5>

  <p class="mt-3">Everything but the baby was an idea born (pun very much intended) out of a need for both baby gear and community.
                  While pregnant and throughout my first year of motherhood I was surprised by 2 things: 1) how quickly babies
                  outgrow the need for certain items (and how pristine they still seem to be when finished with them) and 2) the
                  overwhelming and amazing support offered by other parents. I wanted to create a place where parents can offer their
                  gently used baby gear for an affordable rental price and a community where parents can ask questions, receive support,
                  and celebrate parenting victories.</p>

   <p>I hope that you find this site useful in your parenting journey. If you have questions, concerns or suggestions please send them to me
      via the "contact us" link at the top of the page. Happy Parenting!</p>
